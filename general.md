# General problems

### Problem 1
Q: In learning, from the two key aspects, data ans model, respectively,
what are the key issues we normally consider in order to obtain a
better model?

### Problem 2
Q: Why all machine learning problems are ill-posed?

### Problem 3
Q: Describe from the classification, to clustering, to HMM, to more
complex graphical modeling, what we are trying to do for a more
expressive model?

### Problem 4
Q: What are the potential risks we could take when trying to perform
a logistic regression for classification using a sparsity-based
regularization?

### Problem 5
Q: What are the potential risks we could take when trying to perform
a linear regression using a sparsity-based regularization?

### Problem 6
Q: Give five different structural considerations a search can be
constrained with corresponding simple scalers.

### Problem 7
Q: Give all universal, engineering, and computational principles that
we have learned in this course to obtain both conceptual low-complexity
model and computational tractable algorithms.

### Problem 8
Q: Why data representaion is at least equally as important as the actual
modeling, the so-called representation learning?

### Problem 9
Q: How does the multiple-layer structure (deep learning) become attractive
again?

### Problem 10
Q: What is the trend of AI research and development for the next 5-10 years?

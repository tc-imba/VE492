## Learning and search methods

### Problem 1
Q: What is the loss function? Give three examples (Least Square,
Logistic, Hinge) and describe their shapes and behaviors.

A: Answer here

### Problem 2
Q: Using these losses to approach the actual linear boundary,
inevitably some risks will be incurred; give two different approaches
to remedy the risk using SVM-based hinge loss as an example.

### Problem 3
Q: How many possible models are there given a set of training data?
What is the key assumption of PAC learning for model selection?

### Problem 4
Q: Describe biases and variance issue in learning, and how can we
select and validate an appropriate model?

### Problem 5
Q: How to control model complexity in linear and logistic regression?

### Problem 6
Q: Using the Least Sqaure as the objective function, we try to find the
best set of parameters; what is the statistical justification if the
underlying distribution is Gaussian?

### Problem 7
Q: What does the convexity means in either Least Square-based regression
or Likelihood-based estimation?

### Problem 8
Q: Gradient Decent has a number of different implementations, including
SMO, stochastic methods, as well as a more aggressive Newton method,
what are some if the key issues when using any Gradient-based searching
algorithm?

### Problem 9
Q: What are the five key problems whenever we are talking about modeling
(Existence, Uniqueness, Convexity, Generalizability)? Why they are so
important?

### Problem 10
Q: Give a probabilistic interpretation for logistic regression? How is
it related to the MLE-based generative methods?

### Problem 11
Q: Compare the generative and discriminative methods?

### Problem 12
Q: For the regular and multinomial Na√Øve Bayes, what are their key
assumptions? ~~Why the multinomial methos can be more context sensitive?~~

### Problem 13
Q: What are the key advantages of linear models? What are the key problems
with the complex Neural Network?

### Problem 14
Q: What are three alternatives to approach a constrained maximization problem?

### Problem 15
Q: What id the dual problem? What is strong duality?

### Problem 16
Q: What are the KKT conditions? What is the key implication of them?
Including the origin of SV?

### Problem 17
Q: What is the ideal of soft margin SVM, how is it a nice example of
regularization?

### Problem 18
Q: The idea of kernel? Why not much additional computational complexity?

### Problem 19
Q: What is the general idea behind the kernel? What key computation do
we perform? Why is it so general in data modeling?

### Problem 20
Q: Why we often want to project a distance "measure" to a different space?
